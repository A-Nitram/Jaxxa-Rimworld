  		WORK IN PROGRESS, This module is at an Alpha Stage.
		It shouldn't crash the game (any more), but is still very much a work in progress, so feel free to try it and let me know what you think and what direction you think it should go it.
		
	Requires: ED-Core
Work in Progress, May eventually add Vehicles.
