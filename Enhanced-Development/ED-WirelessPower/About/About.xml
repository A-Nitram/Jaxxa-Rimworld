	Requires: ED-Core
This module allows for the creation of a Wireless power grid.
Wireless power Nodes can transmit or receive power from the grid spanning the entire map. This allows you to establish a remote power generation location such as using a geothermal vent at a far side of the map, or set up advanced turrets, all without having to run power wires across the entire map.
If the grid is overloaded by trying to draw more power that it provides it will completely shut down all receiving nodes and require you to reactivate them.
