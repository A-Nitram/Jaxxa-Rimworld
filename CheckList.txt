This is my checklist for creating a release, there is nothing that you need to worry about in this.

1.Check it is uptodate with GitHub
2.Check the .DLL is upto date (should be automatic now).
3.Check the manual is upto date (Remove unneeded modules in copy) and place PDF is folder. 
4.Zip everything.
5.Remove /bin and /obj in source.
6.Remove any modules not release ready.
7.Upload New Version
8.Upload New Manual
9.Update Tag on GitHub.
