This is my checklist for creating a release, there is nothing that you need to worry about in this.

1.Check the .DLL is upto date (should be automatic now).
2.Check the manual is upto date and PDF'ed.
3.Zip everything.
4.Remove .git folder.
5.Remove .gitignore file.
6.Remove TODO.txt.
7.Remove /bin and /obj in source.
8.Remove any modules not release ready.
9.Remove this file.
10.Update Tag on GitHub.
